        To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding
        something interesting in an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to
        do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see
        them.

        You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You
        can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life.

      <h2>Philippe Halsman</h2>
      <p>
        A true portrait should, today and a hundred years from today, be the
        testimony of how this person looked and what kind of human being he was.
        A portrait is an artistic representation of a person in which the face
        and its expression is predominant. But, it also goes beyond that. The
        deeper purpose of a portrait is to display the likeness, personality and
        even the mood of the person.
